# verific
This tool is designed to verify the multiplier circuits.  <br />
The background of the tool is algebraic backward rewriting. <br />
To run your design download the tool and give the command on terminal as: <br />
./verific your_file.blif  <br />
<br />
sample: <br />
./verific 4bit_1.blif <br />
Old polynomial size: 84     // total number of polynomials generated without reduction <br />
New polynimial size: 64     // total number of polynimials generated after reduction  <br />
Time for backward rewriting: 0.00sec    // time take for algebraic backward rewriting <br />
Overall run Time: 0.01sec    // overall time = time taken for circuit initialization + time taken for backward rewriting. <br />
